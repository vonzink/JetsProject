# JetsProject

# Make Change Project

## Description

You are going to create a fleet of jets with different capabilities.
All jets must have a model, speed (in MPH), range, and price

Jets have a fly() method that prints out the jet details (model, speed, range, price) and the calculated amount of time the jet can fly until it runs out of fuel (based on speed and range).

You must create 2 concrete classes that each extend Jet and implement 1 of your interfaces.

Do not structure your code so that all implementation classes implement all interfaces.
Have your code create at least 2 instances of each of these implementing classes.
