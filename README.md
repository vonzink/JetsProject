# JetsProject


## Description

You are going to create a fleet of jets with different capabilities.
All jets must have a model, speed (in MPH), range, and price

Jets have a fly() method that prints out the jet details (model, speed, range, price) and the calculated amount of time the jet can fly until it runs out of fuel (based on speed and range).

You must create 2 concrete classes that each extend Jet and implement 1 of your interfaces.

Do not structure your code so that all implementation classes implement all interfaces.
Have your code create at least 2 instances of each of these implementing classes.

## technologies used
 - Java
 - Eclipse
 - Git/GitHub
 - Sublime Text Editor
 - zsh
 - Slack lessons

 ## Concepts Applied

    - Conditional Statements
    - Mod
    - Interface / Abstract
    - buffer reader / writer
    - getters / setters
    - constructors
    - CSV .txt
    - exception handling useing try/catch block
    - Array lists
    - UML

 ## Lessons Learned

 - make sure the text and parameter order matches up perfectly. 
 - add the Abstract method to the interface right away so Eclise will create the    Override Method. 
 - use bufIn.readLine() to skip the header in the datat if there is one
 - check or redo the constructor when changing datatypes
 - .trim() dosnt always work to eliminate whitespace on both sides of a split character. 



 ## Notes
 seperating menu from main to keep it cleaner added some additional data. 
 setup some Overloaded methods for additional lines of information in my edited text file. edited the Jet toString for better formatting. 
 added the flighttime equation to the getter in Jet class.
